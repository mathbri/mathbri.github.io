Welcome to my webpage !

I am a second-year PhD student at [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/), the research center in applied mathematics of [Ecole des Ponts](https://ecoledesponts.fr/en), under the supervision of [Axel Parmentier](https://axelparmentier.github.io/). 

My PhD thesis is part of an academic collaboration between Ecole des Ponts and Renault Group, and focuses on large-scale network design problems. My research interest is at the crossroads of operations reserach and machine learning.
